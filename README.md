# Marvin The Paranoid Android
<img src="/imgs/Marvin.jpg" width="250" height="300">

A reddit bot inspired by the "Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and implemented with PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper).

### How does the bot work? :thinking:
To invoke the bot, comment "marvin_thinks" (without quotations) on any post or submission on any subreddit.

Marvin the Paranoid Bot will respond to your comment with something you may find relatable, humorous, or both. Fans of Douglas Adams and the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy are sure to appreciate this bot!

### What if Marvin doesn't notice me?
I currently run the code manually so it may take a while for the bot to reply if I'm away from my computer (or forget :man_shrugging:). I am considering deploying this program using a PaaS provider so this may change!
Another reason that the bot did not notice you may be because of a software bug; I will try to fix those as quickly as I can if they come up.

### How to make your own reddit bot :robot:
1. I recommend you take a look at reddit's [bottiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette).
2. Create a reddit account for your bot or use an existing account (recommend not to do this if it's your main account).
3. Obtain your Reddit API keys which you can find under your User Settings (you'll need these to login).
4. Download dependencies. At the very minimum you'll need to install your desired version of python. If you want to use PRAW, you'll have to install it as well.
5. The quickest way to get started is to look over PRAW's documentation which I have linked below. They have a few tutorials with a great explanation on how everything works.
